These tools are written in C, bash 4, and POSIX awk.

args:
  prints command line arguments given in a very readable format

cfold:
  Wraps input lines in each FILE (standard input if not provided), writing to
  standard output. Also included (although slightly different) in awk-libs as
  an example. must be called with cfold -- [OPTIONS] [FILE...] (the -- as the
  first arg is required)

fah-stats:
  parses the FAH log and gives useful information

fib:
  prints the Nth number of the fibonacci sequence. must be compiled with -lgmp

flatten:
  flattens a directory (recursively moves all files in sub-dirs to the current
  dir, and deletes the sub-dirs)

getmtime:
  usage: getmtime FORMAT FILE [...]
  prints the mtime for each FILE given according to FORMAT. FORMAT is anything
  valid for strftime(3), as well as %N, which will be replaced with FILE.

lessopen:
  this script is for the LESSOPEN env var, and is an "input pipe". it allows
  less to read archives, pdfs (with pdftotext), and will use lynx -dump for html
  to use it, set LESSOPEN='|lessopen %s'

mycp:
  copies files. instead of erring or overwriting, appends numbers to dups
  (work in progress)

myunlink:
  does a call to unlink(2), prints errno and strerr(errno) if it errs

newscript:
  creates a new script, adding the shebang and other things for you. see 
  newscript --help or usage() in the source code

pac_removed
  parses the pacman logfile and lists all removed packages that have not been
  reinstalled. see pac_removed -- -h, or the comments in the source

remove_old:
  removes all but the latest N files in DIR(s).

seg:
  segfaults. for testing purposes.

sub:
  substitutes STR for REP, treating them as literal strings. must be called
  with sub -- [OPTIONS] [FILE...] (the '--' as the first argument is required)

url_encode:
  uses libcurl to escape a given URL. must be compiled with -lcurl

url_decode:
  uses libcurl to decode a given URL. must be compiled with -lcurl

TODO:
  extend mycp, and fix bugs
