These tools are written in C, bash 4, and POSIX awk.

add_times:
  adds each TIME together and prints the result to stdout.

args:
  prints command line arguments given in a very readable format

bar_graph:
  Creates a bar graph of the categories and values in FILE(s) (or the standard
  input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen (-) is given), reading the
  first field as the category and the second as the value. Must be called with
  bar_grap -- [OPTIONS] [FILE...] (the -- is required). See bar_graph -- -h

cfold:
  Wraps input lines in each FILE (standard input if not provided), writing to
  standard output. Also included (although slightly different) in awk-libs as
  an example. must be called with cfold -- [OPTIONS] [FILE...] (the -- as the
  first arg is required)

fah-stats:
  parses the FAH log and gives useful information

fib:
  prints the Nth number of the fibonacci sequence. must be compiled with -lgmp

flatten:
  flattens a directory (recursively moves all files in sub-dirs to the current
  dir, and deletes the sub-dirs)

getmtime:
  usage: getmtime FORMAT FILE [...]
  prints the mtime for each FILE given according to FORMAT. FORMAT is anything
  valid for strftime(3), as well as %N, which will be replaced with FILE.

lessopen:
  this script is for the LESSOPEN env var, and is an "input pipe". it allows
  less to read archives, pdfs (with pdftotext), and will use lynx -dump for html
  to use it, set LESSOPEN='|lessopen %s'

merge:
  Merge sorted FILEs into one, and print the result to the standard output.

mycp:
  copies files. instead of erring or overwriting, appends numbers to dups
  (work in progress)

myunlink:
  does a call to unlink(2), prints errno and strerr(errno) if it errs

newscript:
  creates a new script, adding the shebang and other things for you. see 
  newscript --help or usage() in the source code

noclobber:
  Appends a numeric suffix to FILE, incrementing it until the resulting filename
  no longer exists. Prints the result to the standard output. If FILE already has
  an extension, adds the number before that extension. For example, if FILE is
  `my_file.txt', a possible result would be `my_file.1.txt'. See noclobber -h,
  or the comments in the source

nsplit:
  numeric version of split(1) written in POSIX awk. must be called with
  nsplit -- [OPTIONS] [FILE ...] (the -- is required). see nsplit -- -h, or the
  comments in the source

pac_removed:
  parses the pacman logfile and lists all removed packages that have not been
  reinstalled. see pac_removed -- -h, or the comments in the source

psort:
  sort implementation that allows prioritizing the sort by pattern.
  see psort -- -h, or the comments in the source

remove_old:
  removes all but the latest N files in DIR(s).

seg:
  segfaults. for testing purposes.

sub:
  substitutes STR for REP, treating them as literal strings. must be called
  with sub -- [OPTIONS] [FILE...] (the '--' as the first argument is required)

url_encode:
  uses libcurl to escape a given URL. must be compiled with -lcurl

url_decode:
  uses libcurl to decode a given URL. must be compiled with -lcurl

TODO:
  extend mycp, and fix bugs
